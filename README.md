# Crainix UAM
Understanding Advanced Maths repository of the brain-friendly math program for learning algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and other advanced maths. 
This is the first draft, "minimum viable product" version of the program, which is a set of PowerPoint Decks. There are typos and the decks are going through continual improvement. 
Here are PDF files of the units for the first draft version of the Understanding Advanced Maths program. 
The PDFs are too large to view well in GitHub so you can download or contact crainix@outlook.com to get versions emailed to you or for interactive one-on-one or group online sessions of the material.  
Collaborators are welcome!
